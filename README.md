This is just a trial I did a while back using my own 3d Model I created in Blender as well as using animations from mixamo and attempting to blend states. 
The blending states worked pretty well, but I did not figure out the attack animations, might go back and fix it
Good basis for a platormer though and taught me a lot about Blender, Animations, and Blend States as well as basic game logic
